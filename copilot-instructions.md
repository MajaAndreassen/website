# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for Blog Posts

## Writing Style
- Use simple, clear, and natural language.
- Avoid jargon, technical buzzwords, and marketing speak.
- Write as if explaining to a friend or a general audience.
- Prefer short sentences and paragraphs.
- Use active voice whenever possible.

## Formatting
- Do **not** use "em" bindings (no <em> tags or Markdown *emphasis*).
- Use plain text or headings for emphasis instead.
- Structure posts with clear headings and subheadings.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when needed.

## Tone
- Be friendly, approachable, and informative.
- Avoid overly formal or academic tone.
- Focus on making content accessible to everyone.

## Example
**Bad:**
> "Leverage cutting-edge synergies to optimize your workflow."

**Good:**
> "Here are some simple ways to make your work easier."
