Iceland had been on my list for years, and finally making it there in December was both challenging and magical.

## The Landscapes

Nothing prepares you for Iceland's raw beauty. The contrast between the black volcanic beaches and the pristine glaciers is otherworldly. Every turn in the road reveals something that looks like it belongs on another planet.

### Highlights

- **Northern Lights**: Finally caught them on night three after two cloudy attempts
- **Blue Lagoon**: Touristy but undeniably relaxing
- **Gullfoss Waterfall**: Powerful and humbling
- **Reynisfjara Beach**: Black sand and dramatic sea stacks

## The Solitude

Traveling solo in Iceland's winter taught me about comfortable solitude. Hours of driving through empty landscapes with nothing but your thoughts creates a unique headspace I hadn't experienced before.

## Practical Notes

- Rent a 4WD vehicle, seriously
- Pack layers, lots of layers
- Download offline maps
- Budget more than you think for food

## Would I Go Back?

Absolutely. Already planning a summer trip to see the highlands and experience the midnight sun.

Iceland reminded me why I travel - not just to see new places, but to see the world (and yourself) differently.
