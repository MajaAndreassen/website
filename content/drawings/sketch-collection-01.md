An exploration of forms and lines captured in today's sketching session. This piece focuses on [describe what you see in the drawing - could be portraits, landscapes, objects, abstract forms, etc.].

Part of my ongoing daily drawing practice, documenting moments and observations through quick sketches and studies.
