In 2023, my husband Fredrik and I bought the old local village shop in my home village Rotsund, embarking on an ambitious project to transform it into something special for our family and community.

## The Vision

Rotsund is a small village in Northern Norway with breathtaking views of the Lyngen Alps and fjord. When the old village shop came up for sale, we saw an opportunity to create something meaningful - a place where we could stay when visiting my family, while also sharing this incredible location with others.

## The Project

We've applied to rebuild the old shop into a modern cabin that will serve dual purposes:

- **Family retreat**: A comfortable base for when we visit my family in Rotsund
- **Rental accommodation**: Sharing this magical location with travelers seeking authentic Northern Norwegian experiences
- **Community connection**: Maintaining a link to the village's commercial heritage

## The Location

Rotsund offers visitors an authentic taste of life in Northern Norway:

- Spectacular views of the Lyngen Alps
- Direct access to fjord activities
- Traditional fishing village atmosphere
- Perfect base for exploring the region
- Midnight sun in summer, northern lights in winter

## Technical Approach

Beyond the physical renovation, we've built a web presence to showcase the project:

- **Dual domain strategy**: Both .com and .no domains to serve international and Norwegian audiences
- **Visual storytelling**: Documenting the transformation from village shop to modern cabin
- **Booking integration**: Seamless reservation system for future guests
- **Local insights**: Sharing knowledge about the area and activities

## Current Status

We're currently in the planning and approval phase, working with local authorities on the renovation permits. The project combines respect for the building's history with modern comfort and sustainability.

## What We're Learning

This project is teaching us about:

- **Heritage preservation**: Balancing historical significance with modern needs
- **Community impact**: How tourism can support rather than disrupt local life
- **Sustainable development**: Building practices that respect the Arctic environment
- **Cultural bridge-building**: Connecting international visitors with Norwegian culture

## Next Steps

- Finalizing renovation permits and plans
- Beginning the physical transformation
- Developing partnerships with local activity providers
- Creating content that showcases the region's natural beauty
- Building a community of respectful travelers

Lyngen Seaside represents our commitment to creating meaningful connections between people and place, honoring the past while building for the future.
