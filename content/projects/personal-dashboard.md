I've always been fascinated by personal dashboards - single screens that give you an overview of what matters most in your day.

## The Problem

I was juggling multiple apps and services to check weather, track habits, monitor goals, and review my daily schedule. Context switching between apps was eating into my productivity and creating decision fatigue first thing in the morning.

## The Solution

A custom dashboard that aggregates everything I need to see in one place:

- Today's weather and forecast
- Habit tracking with streak counters
- Calendar events for the day
- Quick notes and tasks
- Motivational quote or image

## Technical Approach

Built with Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for data persistence. The design prioritizes information density while remaining clean and readable.

### Key Features

- **Habit Tracking**: Simple checkboxes with streak tracking
- **Weather Integration**: Using OpenWeatherMap API
- **Calendar Sync**: Google Calendar integration
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic based on system preference

## Current Status

The core functionality is complete and I've been using it daily for three months. Currently working on adding more data sources and improving the mobile experience.

## What I Learned

Building something you use every day creates a tight feedback loop for improvement. Small friction points become obvious quickly, leading to better user experience overall.

The project taught me the value of progressive enhancement - starting with the minimum viable version and iteratively adding features based on actual usage patterns.

## Next Steps

- Integration with fitness tracking apps
- Better visualization of habit trends
- Social features for accountability
- API for third-party integrations

This project exemplifies my approach to personal tools: simple, functional, and built to last.
