I resisted mechanical keyboards for years, thinking they were just an expensive trend. Boy was I wrong.

## The Switch

After developing some wrist pain from long coding sessions, I decided to give the Keychron K8 a try. The difference was immediate - not just in comfort, but in the tactile feedback that made typing genuinely enjoyable.

## What I Love

- **Tactile feedback**: Every keystroke feels intentional
- **Customization**: Hot-swappable switches mean I can experiment
- **Build quality**: Feels like it will last forever
- **Sound**: The satisfying click (though maybe not for everyone)

## The Downsides

- **Price**: Quality mechanical keyboards aren't cheap
- **Learning curve**: Different switches take time to get used to
- **Noise**: Can be disruptive in shared spaces

## Verdict

Worth every penny. My typing speed improved, and more importantly, my wrists thank me. If you spend hours at a keyboard daily, consider it an investment in your health.

**Rating**: 4/5 stars
